## Election-Audit Summary:

1. For future voting extercises, the code could be used really easily if the data type and format maintains and the code oer se has little or no dependencies on changes to the code; if we have more counties or more voters or more candidates, the code will still be able to work.
2. In the future we could also try to understand the winner per county to see if that would also imply that Diana was the winner or maybe Diana was a winner only for Denver county.In this case, I would add a for loop statement before counting the number of candidates loop; this for loop would have to work for every candidate´s name wihtout putting it manually to continue working with the overall percentages to continue accomplishing bullet "1.".
